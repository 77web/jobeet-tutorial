# Jobeet Day 8: The Forms

Any website has forms, from the simple contact form to the complex ones with lots of fields.
Writing forms is also one of the most complex and tedious task for a web developer: you need to write the HTML form, implement validation
rules for each field, process the values to store them in a database, display error messages, repopulate fields in case of errors, and much moreâ€¦

## Create the Job Form

To deal with creation of jobs we will need forms, that in Symfony are realized by [Form Component][3].
The Form component allows you to easily create, process and reuse forms.
We will crate a class that generally is `Form Builder` class. There we will define fields, that form should have, validation rules and many other things.
So, let's create a folder `src/Form` where all forms will be placed and to create our first form in file `JobType.php`:

```php
namespace App\Form;

use Symfony\Component\Form\AbstractType;
use Symfony\Component\Form\FormBuilderInterface;
use Symfony\Component\OptionsResolver\OptionsResolver;

class JobType extends AbstractType
{
    /**
     * {@inheritdoc}
     */
    public function buildForm(FormBuilderInterface $builder, array $options)
    {

    }

    /**
     * {@inheritdoc}
     */
    public function configureOptions(OptionsResolver $resolver)
    {

    }
}
```

As you can notice, our class extends `AbstractType` class and usually you will have to work with `buildForm` and `configureOptions` methods.
That's why we defined them from the beginning.

Every form needs to know the name of the class that holds the underlying data.
Let's specify the `data_class` option by changing `configureOptions` method:

```php
public function configureOptions(OptionsResolver $resolver)
{
    $resolver->setDefaults([
        'data_class' => Job::class
    ]);
}
```

*Note: don't forget to import `Job` class*
